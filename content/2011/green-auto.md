Indian, I am sure the words like "air pollution", "sound pollution" and "word pollution" (abuses) are synonymous to auto. If you are from a western country, "auto" word will bring back the memories of a roller-coaster ride for you. Let us look at the state of affairs in Karnataka (especially Mysore and Bangalore). I was always wondering why there are so many KL (Kerala) registered autos in Mysore. Finally got to know from an auto-driver that Kerala has strict norms against the old autos, so they push all the old autos to Karnataka (Mysore being close to Kerala, it has become a natural place to dispose off the waste). But from last few years, even Karanatka government is pushing for Green auto - the one which runs on CNG, which will atleast help to reduce one of the pollutions autos are known for. But, looks like this initiative has not gone well with all the "Green auto" drivers. May be they are forced to shell out more to buy a Green auto. May be they cannot fill the tank with low cost fuel (a.k.a. Kerosine) anymore. Anyways, while coming to office today, a Green auto caught my attention for the message it was carrying on its back. 

Message : "ನಮ್ಮ ಬೆಂಗಳೂರಿನಲ್ಲಿ ಹಚ್ಚ ಹಸಿರಾದ ನಿರ್ಮಲವಾದ ನೈಸರ್ಗಿಕವಾಗಿ ಸ್ವಚ್ಚ ಗಾಳಿಯನ್ನು ಕೊಡುವ ಮರಗಳನ್ನು ಕಡಿದು ಮನೆಗಳನ್ನು ಕಟ್ಟಿ, ರಸ್ತೆ ಅಗಲೀಕರಣ ಮಾಡಲು ವೃಕ್ಷಗಳ ಮಾರಣ ಹೋಮಗಳನ್ನು ಮಾಡಿ ನಮ್ಮ ನಿರ್ಜೀವವಾದ ಆಟೋ ಗಳಿಗೆ ಹಸಿರು ಬಣ್ಣ ಬಳಿದರೇನು ಪ್ರಯೋಜನ?" (What is the use of painting autos Green, when the trees are cut in the name of road-widening and construction of houses?)

Well, I wanted to tell this driver that each one of us can really make a difference - however small it is, but did not dare to do it as I was driving alone in my car with AC on :-(
