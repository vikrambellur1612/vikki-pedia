Hurray, hurrya, its a holiday, holi-holiday... Christmas is around the corner and with that comes a well deserved holiday season for many.

Last year, we had gone to Puri-Bhubhaneshwar for christmas, but this year, we have just decided to skip the Christmas vacation with any big plans of trip (having already finished our quota in October).

We have been hearing about 10's of thousands of people stranded in different airports in Europe, mad rush of travellers everywhere, atleast no regrets to skip this christmas vacation.

Will be visiting my home town of childhood days - Bhadravathi - after almost 12 years. All excited and looking forward to spending christmas in this little town, am sure there will not be any other soul to disturb our peace there. Hope Veena and Poorvi also relish this off-beat place as much as I always did (and still do).
