Veena and me are trying Aqua aerobics from last weekend. This is something really different and most important of all, I don't sweat and there is no "pressure" on the legs :-) That gives a feeling that I am not tired and can work out longer :-) Not sure, if this exercise is really effective, but atleast it is fun. We were made to "sit" in the water with floaters under the armpit and pedal an imaginary pedal-boat. We were suppose to go forward and also backward pedaling like this :-) I had to unlearn some of my swimming techniques to do these exercise. It is so difficult to resist swimming and do jogging in the water. So difficult to pedal the boat and not do a back stroke.

Veena especially had some problem on the first day. She could not stand properly in the swimming pool as the swimming pool depth is more in Woodrose club. She was literally on her "toes". However on the second day, she enjoyed the exercise with the help of floaters.

Let us see, how effective this is going to be. But they promise lot of fun games too as part of this aqua aerobics. Atleast I am enjoying and looking forward to the next classes. A good swim at the end of the training session is like an icing on the cake.
