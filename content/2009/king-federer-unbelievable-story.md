King is here to stay, he is back in the "rank" he deserves the best: Number ONE. It was a memorable day for all tennis buffs yesterday when Fed-ex created the history - for being the king of grandslam 15 times, what an achievement in just 6 years (compared to Sampras who took 12 years to win 14 grandslams). Uff... its really an "unbelievable story".

What a match it was yesterday. Both Roddick and Federer were matching each other to the last point played. 5-7, 7-6, 7-6, 3-6, 16-14 !!! The score speaks for itself. Federer served 50 odd "Aces" and would have uttered the word "unbelievable" same number of times in the post match ceremony.

Just think of the great comeback by Federer. He had lost the first set and in the second set, he was on the brink of another loss (trailing 6-2 in the tie-breaker). But what a come back !!! "Unbelievable", but true.

I just loved the game yesterday. Not because my favorite Federer won, but the way the game was played. Both the players played like true gentlemen, they had kept their emotions under control, no outbursts, not much of celebrations after winning a great winner or a great game. At the end of the match, I really felt little sad for Roddick, as he had an upper hand initially in the match and gave it away.

I just loved the way each of them came back with big serves. In the final set, many times Federer was down 15-30. Everytime, he used to come back with 3 Aces to just finish any threat of a break. Similarly Roddick, at any of the break points, he came with an Ace or a winner. He saved as much as 6 break points speaks for itself.

During the final set, I was just thinking, if Federer can ever break Roddick's serve? He had never broken Roddick's serve till the last game in the 5th set !!! And it did happen.... in the last game of the last set !!! Uff... Unbelievable.
