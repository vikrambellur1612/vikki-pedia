Every city, every town has some special shops/business which is very well known to the local people, but the outsiders may not have a clue of these places. There are so many food joints like that in Bangalore. Each locality in Bangalore will have atleast one such special establishment which even other locality people may not be aware of. Similarly there are few good places in Mysore too. When we were in Mysore over the last weekend, we visited two such places. Although both these places are not new to us (having spent few years in Mysore), but I am sure people from outside Mysore would not be aware of these nice places.

First, we visited a place called "KSC" (Karnataka Saree Centre), a government establishment dealing with apparels. This place is just diagonally opposite to the Mysore zoo front gate. Its a must-go place for all ladies especially, as there are umpteen variety of dress materials, sarees at almost the cost price of the material. We were amazed to see some very nice dress materials starting at 160 Rs. Wow, beat that price anywhere else. Veena had a fantastic time shopping there for almost 2 hours and I was happy that such a big shopping did not dent a hole in my pocket :-) There are also range of bed spreads and shirt/pant material for men.

Just today, I was listening on the radio about a new saree (Kanchivaram silk) getting launched today in Bangalore. Looks like Vishnuvardhan is going to unveil this new saree in Malleshwaram today. It is dubbed as the costliest saree, priced at Rs 2 Lakh. Different worlds? Eh.

Our second visit in Mysore was to a place which I like the most :-) Its a sweet stall in one of the by-roads of Kuvempunagar in Mysore. When I used to reside in Mysore, this establishment was run in a small home/shed and there were limited number of sweets/khara on the offer. I had a similar picture in my mind when we visited this place to get some sweets/snacks this time. Wow, to my amazement, this has become a big shop at the same place. One can now see people queuing up to buy sweets and also there are many supplementary business (like soda guy, vegetable seller etc) surrounding this establishment. Wow. Best part of this shop is the consistent taste and very very low price for the sweets/khara. In fact, many of the other retail vendors come to this place, buy sweets in bulk and resell it at higher price. So, next time when you are in Mysore, don't forget to visit this "Udipi Krishna Sweets" in Kuvempurnagar (off Adi-Chunchanagiri road, close to Cauvery school). Try their special "sajjappa", "bellada kobbari mithai" and a range of "kodbaLe" and "chakkali". Its really worth a visit and makes your visit to Mysore all the more memorable.
