# A holiday - Why was it for?

Last Friday was declared as a holiday in Karnataka for all government offices, schools & colleges. Reason? To mourn the sudden, sad demise of YSR, chief minister of Andhra Pradesh. There is a saying in Kannada - "ಎತ್ತಿಗೆ ಜ್ವರ ಬಂದರೆ ಎಮ್ಮೆಗೆ ಬರೆ ಹಾಕಿದರಂತೆ". It was a case something like that. Due respects to YSR & his achievements and indeed it was a very tragic incident. But, why a holiday in Karnataka?

Anyway, Poorvi did not complain. She asked me why was it a holiday on Friday. What can you tell to a 4 year old? I thought at least this is the time for her to understand what is a city, what is a state, which is our state, which is our neighbouring state, who is our chief-minister, who was neighbouring state's chief minister etc.

So, I started asking few basic questions like - "Which is our city, which is our state, which is our country" etc to Poorvi. With some guesses, she was able to answer them anyway :-) Now the big moment - "Who is the chief minister of Karnataka"? Well, Poorvi knows Yeddiyurappa. I thought she might answer this correctly or at the most say "Manmohan Singh", if she had some confusion.

Poorvi thought for a moment and guessed - "Pratibha Patel"!!!! Wow, that was a complete googly for me. How did she know about Pratibha Patel, president of India? I did not probe much into it, but I clarified these confusions & then explained about YSR and his death in helicopter crash. Poorvi said, she already knew about that news, she watched it in TV & I was not giving any new information to her. :-( Oh... I thought I was really far behind in getting the news updates than Poorvi.

Anyway, on Friday morning Poorvi was explaining about her new-found knowledge to one of her friend - "some man was travelling in some helicopter. Somewhere it crashed and he died, so we have a holiday today". Very simple explanation isn't it? I was just wondering again - why was the holiday for.
