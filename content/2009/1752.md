(Dedicated to my one and only wife - Veena, without whom life after 1752 would have been empty and meaningless :-) )

Ha, what a topic to have a blog on? 1752? What is the number all about? Well, its been more than just a number to me and veena !!!

Lets go back to history to find some relevance of this number :-) Its been almost always associated with the begining of a new era/life......

Year 1752 has lots of significance, that was the year when Brits and US colonies started following Gregorian calender ( modern day calender), the beginning of a new era in the history.... for all practical purposes, 1752 is referred to as the start of Gregorian calender year.....

RFC 1752 aptly talks about IP-next generation protocol..... again the new era in the networking world !!!!!!

Well, is it a coincidence that 17-5-2 happens to be my marriage day?? ;-)) It was exactly 7 years ago on the 17th day of May, I started a whole new life with Veena :-)

Hmm.. and we decided to have this special number -1752 - on our first car's number plate. Even today, on the road, I look for any vehicle with number 1752 on it, which kind of gives me a special attachment :-)

So, you know, 1752 is just not another number for us :-)
