(Bhagavantha Kai Kotta dhudiyokantha, adhanyake yettuve hodeyokantha : God has given hand to work, why do you lift it to hit someone?)

Have you guys ever thought about this popular phrase in Kannada - "Kai yettodhu"? (also known as "lifting the hands"). This phrase is used to indicate "cheating" or "giving up" on something. There is something which you had committed to do but could not do, so one can then tell - "Kai yettbitte maga" (I lifted my hands, son) :-)

I was wondering why this phrase would have come into existence? :-) I was thinking in all different situations when we lift hands. In our school days we used to lift our hands if we knew answer to a question. In many other situations (like in some LIVE contest you want to participate), you lift your hand to get noticed. So, in all these situations, lifting hands does not mean that you have given up on something (except your shyness). It is a way to get noticed.

In some sports, you really need to lift your hand (like swimming, while playing tennis or badminton etc), but it does not really mean anything, just part of the game.

Otherwise, as the popular kannada song goes, lifting the hand also often ends up in getting beaten :-(

I found in one exact place where "lifting hand" is "giving it up". Have you seen cricket matches closely? A batsman hits the ball, a fielder tries to get across to the ball, if he is not able to reach, he "lifts his hand" (which means that he has given up) and other fielder goes to the ball :-)

I am seriously thinking, if this popular phrase was an invention of an over enthusiastic Indian cricket fan? Do you have any thoughts? :-)
