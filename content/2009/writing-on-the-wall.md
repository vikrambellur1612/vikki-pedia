Do you remember sometime back there was a hysteria about "NaaLe ba" (Come tomorrow) ghost. Many of the houses in different villages & towns used to have this script (NaaLe baa) written on their front doors to fool & shoo away the "devva" (ghost) at that time. Belief was that this "Devva" would read "NaaLe baa" and come back again next day to read the same script thus ending up in an infinite loop.

Well, now a different kind of hysteria has started in & around our apartment (JP Nagar, Bannerghatta road, BTM layout). This time, it is a different kind, thanks to the overnight work of the BBMP guys over last couple of days (or should I call it night?). One can see some alphanumeric words (like 7.035M, 12M etc) written on most of the compound walls of the apartments, houses, business complex around BTM layout, JP Nagar & Bannerghatta road. If you just neglect this as one more identification mark/address to your home, then you are mistaken. This is part of BBMP's "Bruhat Bangalore" project, where they are widening the roads (from existing 4 lane to 6 lanes). You can refer to the earlier article in Vikki-Pedia - "[Buffalos and Bangalore](http://vikki-pedia.blogspot.com/2009/06/buffalos-and-bangalore.html)"on the development plans for Bannerghatta road, but I never thought BBMP will act so fast. These number on the wall indicate the extent to which each of the buildings along the road will get affected :-( Moreover the writing on our wall (refer to the photo) just indicates "12.00", we do not know, if it is centimeter, meter, kilometer or feet :-( This has come as a weekend shocker to many of the residents in this locality and all of us are keeping the fingers crossed that the damage due to this road widening activity does not literally throw us to the "streets".
