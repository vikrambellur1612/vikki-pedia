Have you been following the biggest pre-wedding show happening on television? It can put some of the big movies and some soap operas to shame. Yes, I am talking about "Rakhi ka Swayamwar" on NDTV imagine, a reality show to choose a groom for Rakhi :-)

Some of the scenes reminds one of "Hum Aapke hain Kaun", while other episodes have so much masala into it, even Ekta Kapoor would not have thought about it; already married guy (with three kids) being there in the race to marry Rakhi, another guy kissing Rakhi while dancing (which made into the headlines on one TV channel yesterday) :-) Uh... the twists and turns continues.

The whole show seems to be well stage managed. May be there were multiple round of rehearsals. I really wonder, if this is really a reality show? Will Rakhi really marry someone at the end of this show? Whatever it is, going by the TRP of the program, for sure Rakhi would have made a fortune for her life through this program. All that remains to be seen is "who is going to be the biggest bakara" at the end of the show, is it one of the guys in the show OR audience like us :-)
