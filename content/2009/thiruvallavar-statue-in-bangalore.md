D-day is 9th August: Thiruvallavar statue will be unveiled in Bangalore. Sarvagna statue in Chennai. Thiru... who? Don't know him? Neither do I. Statue of him in Bangalore, why? This is the same questions many of the Kannada organizations are asking. Even I do not see any use in having Thiruvallavar's statue in Bangalore and Sarvagna's in Chennai. What do Tamilians know about Sarvagna? Will the Tamilians and Kannadigas give respect to Sarvagna and Thiruvallavar's statue respectively? I don't think so. Matter of days when someone notices how badly one particular statue is maintained in one state and other state taking a revenge on the other statue. We have already seen the report in papers on how badly Sarvagna's statue was treated in Chennai, few days before installing it. :-( Is it not a good option to have Sarvagan's statue in Bangalore itself & Thiruvallavar's in Chennai?

Instead of concentrating on these statues, if both Karnataka and TN work out an amicable solution for water-sharing (cauvery water) & border issues (Hogenakal) it is good for everyone.
