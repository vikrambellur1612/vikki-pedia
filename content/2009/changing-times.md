I remember, as a kid, I used to play almost till 7 in the evening, when the light was not sufficient anymore to sight the ball in the game of cricket. Typically our evening games used to start around 5 PM (after the school hours) and go on till it gets dark. All our home-works and other studies used to start only after 7 PM :-) (actually I was wondering, if we were to have the extended daylight during summer, we would have played till 10 in the night :-) )

Nowadays, in our apartment, I see children playing all the way till 9 in the evening. I was really wondering about the "school-life" balance of these kids :-) When do these kids study? When do they do their homework?

Last week, after a late-night basketball match with these kids, some of us (uncles :-) ) were talking to these kids. It seems, most of these kids come back home by 4 in the afternoon from schools. Immediately they do their homeworks and study all the way till 7 in the evening. They come out only by 7 and play till 9. Their logic was simple. "We cannot do studies after playing uncle" :-) So true. This 7 to 9 schedule also suits their parents, who can watch their favourite serials on TV, without much bothering about kids' homework and studies.

Hmm... Changing times, Changing life style, all for good I suppose.
