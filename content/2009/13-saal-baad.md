*(Article dedicated to Gangu, Harsha and Chinna who made it to this small get-together :-) )*

Last week, while waiting for my office cab, in front of our apartment, I met a person with some familiarity. I started mapping this person to someone known in the past. My memory had to go all the way 13 years back to recognize this person as my classmate in the engineering college. It was a real happy moment to get in touch with a good old friend, who was completely out of touch for 13 years(but for some Orkut moments). Immediately we exchanged our contacts and decided to catch up during the weekend.

Last weekend, it was time for a small re-union of classmates. It was a real good time catching up with the old memories - how a classmate of ours had volunteered go give a "drop" to a teacher and actually "dropped" the teacher (accidentally) on the way to college, how another classmate used to memorize each line of microprocessor program and ended up displaying the other college's name (NIE) instead of our college name (SJCE) on the output (as he had memorized the program written by his friend in other college) so on.

Obviously, there were lot of discussions about our professors, teachers and others. It was not only just the memories of 13 year back, at the end of the day we all felt 13 years younger :-) It is always nice to catch up with old friends. Hope this kind get-together happen more often and lot more of our old friends join this.

One of my dream is to have a re-union in the college itself, just visiting all those favorite hot-spots in the college - Cycle stand (I guess it is a car stand now :-)), canteen, downs (in front of our college) etc. Hope I don't have to wait for another 13 years for this dream to come true :-)
