Rhymes time is always a nice time. Poorvi is almost singing a different rhymes each day now !!! It is really really nice to hear those rhymes in the kids own way of pronunciations :-)

When Poorvi was about 2.5 years old, one day she came back from school (Kidzee) and started pestering us to teach her the "Dante Shabaru" rhymes. Uh, Dante Shabaru? With some difficulty I can recite "Twinkle twinkle" or "Ba ba black sheep". But Dante shabaru? Was completely stumped. I had to accept the defeat and told Poorvi that I was not aware of any such rhymes. This continued for some more days, almost everyday she was asking us if we know "Dante Shabaru" rhymes. One fine day, Poorvi was playing with her toys and singing " Tava Subha Ashisa Mage, Dante shabaru Gatha". Then we understood, what rhymes Poorvi was really "talking" about :-) We were really surprised to know that she could recite complete Jana-gana-mana at that age (with little support to correct those words though :-)).

Offlate, just last week, similar incident happened. Poorvi started singing "Uthe sabke kadam, tara ram pa pam"... and then some totally strange english words followed which sounded like "I am only ninety nine, I am only ninety nine". We did not know the wordings again and we were thinking this as "Dante shabaru" part-2.

When we met her teacher last weekend and asked her about this "uther sabke kadam" rhymes, teacher said, she is very passionate about rhymes and she is teaching the kids some "out-of-syllabus" rhymes also. Poorvi's teacher said, she gets all these nice rhymes from internet and teaches the students.

Yesterday, Veena did a quick search in the internet about this "new" rhyme and this is what she got:

*(This is to be sung in the tune of the popular song from "Baton Baton main")*

**Uthe Sabake Kadam, Taraa Ram-Pam-Pam**  
**Ajii Aise Giit Gaayaa Karo**  
**Kabhii Khushii Kabhii Gam, Taraa Ram-Pam-Pam**  
**Ha.Nso.N Aur Ha.Nsaayaa Karo**

**Said the hundred legged worm, as he began to squirm,**  
**"Has anybody seen a leg of mine?**  
**If it can't be found then I'll have to hop around,**  
**on the other ninety-nine, on the other ninety-nine."**  
**Hop around, hop around,**  
**On the other ninety nine,**  
**If it can't be found then I'll have to hop around,**  
**On the other ninety-nine, on the other ninety-nine**

Beautiful rhyme, isn't it? I can very well empathize with this hundred legged worm, exactly knowing the importance of leg (having fractured my leg few times). I was just wondering, if this 100 legged worm really going to miss one leg or can it manage with rest 99? :-)
