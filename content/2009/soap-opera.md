# Soap Opera

Poorvi wanted to get a new soap, so we went to a nearby shop to get the soap. Poorvi was very clear in her choice - "Doy" soap. She had seen some advertisement on TV and wanted the same soap, come what may. After a few rounds of search, we found the Doy soap in one corner of the shop. It came in pack of 3 (which seems to be a new trend with most soaps these days) & it also had a free gift (coloring box). Poorvi was very happy. Little did she know how her expectation "bubble" going to burst in few hours from then, when she started using the soap. More on that bubble later.

While searching for Doy soap, I had the opportunity to glance at all other new & old soaps in the market. How much this soap market has changed. In fact there was an ad in a news paper last week that "Lifebuoy soap is known to protect against H1N1 virus". Wow, amazing isn't it. Everyone is making hay while the virus shines. First it was N95 masks and similar ones. Then came homeopathic medicine which is preventive against swine flu. Now, it is a soap. More than anyone else, it is the doctors & the hospitals which are having the last smile. Such an ad from Lifebuoy really creates an impression and I almost bought it (not for fighting against H1N1, but its a long long time since I used this soap & wanted to try).

Almost every soap (cinthol, Dettol, Margo, Liril etc) has a "new" tag attached to it with little bit of twist to its fragrance, to attract the people looking for a change. But for those nostalgic ones, there are still the old versions of cinthol, Liril, Margo soaps in tact :-)

OK, back to Poorvi & her bubble. Poorvi had seen on TV that Doy soaps can create bubbles. Her first wash with Doy soap was anything but a big disappointment. "Where is the bubble" was her question. I tried to explain that in the next wash it might come. Next time around, I put more soap into her hands and asked her to rub more. She does so and lo, there are bubbles. I gave a victorious smile at Poorvi. But Poorvi was still frowning & said - "Papa, I don't want these round bubbles, I want an elephant bubble which they show on Doy soap advertisement. Where is it?" !!!! Oh God, somebody please help me.
