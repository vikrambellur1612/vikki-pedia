The small kids must have been singing "Rain Rain go away" quite a lot during last one month. For the first time in so many years, I am witnessing a dry month of June. With KRS is having water just enough to last for another 15 days or so, with power enough to supply for next 10 days, situation is gloomy.

Call it global warming, call it nature's fury, but looks to me like hard days ahead in this year for Indians :-( We can expect chain reactions now, with lower crops, increased commodity prices, dispute over cauvery river water sharing etc etc. All these are not new, but if it does not rain NOW, these issues could become really severe :-(

But not everyone is complaining about rains. Take for example BBMP(Bangalore Munciple). Usually they get all the attention for all wrong reasons during these months. Well, for once, BBMP has taken some proactive action in anticipation of rainy season :-) I am not sure if "proactive" is the correct word, as they started cleaning the storm water drains in late June. Luckily for them, it did not rain during or before that. So, when it really rains (hopefully today onwards :-) ), the BBMP work will be put to test.

I am really missing those heavy rains which I enjoy watching from our balcony, reading some nice books with a hot cup of tea and some hot "bhajji/bonda" to go alongwith it. When will I experience it again? Rain, Rain, where are you?
