It's been almost 1.5 years that the most talked about "word" in the whole "world" happens to be "recession". There are indications, contra-indications that world is coming out of recession. No one is really sure when recession is going to end and world will again start looking at progressive development.

India inc does not seem to be really bothered about "Buffalos" and its impact, for now. Although some real "buffalos" had to give way for explosive development of India in last few years, the latest Obama "bomb" (yes, this time the bomb is from Obama, not Osama) has promised to bring those "buffalos" back to where it belonged once upon a time. Buffalos must be having a silent laugh and thanking Obama for this fortune that at-least they can be safe in whatever places, pastures they are right now and not be bothered to shooed away for another round of development in Bangalore / India.

Well, "Buffalos" are wrong, going by the amount of investment India Inc is doing in the infrastructure development these days. Just look at a "small" plan for just Bannerghatta road, in next couple of years. There is a 32 storied apartment complex (with 2 flats per floor) alongwith an IT park coming up next to Mantri Elite on Bannerghatta road. And just opposite to that, a Taj 5-star hotel alongwith a big mall comprising of Lifestyle, multiplexes are coming up. The 2 flat per floor apartment is going to cost anything between 1.5 crores to 8 crores (it seems). Mono-rail soil testing is on going for Bannerghatta road. This is just the story of one road. There are very similar stories happening in different parts of Bangalore.

Just yesterday I was driving through AnandRao circle to Nrupathunga road via KR circle, oh my God !!!!!! I was amazed to see the whole landscape has changed beyond recognition, KR circle has become signal-free, with so many criss-cross roads that resembles F1 track :-) For a while, I was really lost, if I was going on the right road, in the right direction :-)

So, all you "buffalos", watch out. India Inc is growing strong and stronger day by day. Jai Ho Bangalore !!! Jai Ho India !!!
