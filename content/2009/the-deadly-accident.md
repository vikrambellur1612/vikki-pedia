# The "deadly" accident

*(With Special Thanks to that anonymous person who clicked the photos in this article)*

There was a major traffic jam on outer ring road and on Marathalli bridge today. Apparently there was a "deadly" accident which caused this. The goods carrier (like auto) rammed against a lorry. The goods carrier person had supplied milk to our office in the morning and was going back, which happened to be his last journey :-( I think the pictures below speak for whatever happened. Very unfortunate :-(

The way these goods carriers, cabs and water tankers are driven in Bangalore, they are always asking for trouble :-( Early in the morning, with no traffic, he would have just lost one or two minutes in his journey, if he was going cautiously. Uh, do they really care for themselves & others? :-(
