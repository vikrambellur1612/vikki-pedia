# Poorvi's Birthday

October 31st is Poorvi's birthday. We are getting ready to celebrate her birthday. Its going to be a small party at home, with all Poorvi's near & dear friends. Poorvi is already looking forward to this day eagerly and has started the count down. For her, it is a day full of love, getting all the attention & getting pampered.

As we grow older, our birthdays are limited to the cursory wishes either on SMS or on facebook :-) The real joy of this special day is when you are really young, when you get so many surprises - either in the form of some special food or in the form of gift, with all love & care from parents & friends.

Poorvi is getting a special gift this time from us. It is a all-new looking her own bedroom with special bed & study table alongwith bookshelf. Room is also painted new & Poorvi is all excited about her new room, just waiting to show it off to her friends on Saturday. :-) It was almost a month long effort to look for proper furniture, catching hold of painter, getting the furniture fixed etc. Finally it was all ready yesterday night & Poorvi in fact has already started using her new study table for completing her homework.

I hope Poorvi will have all the fun on her birthday & we are all looking forward to a great day too on October 31st.
