Last week, I had gone to a dentist and waiting for the doctor to turn up. Doctor said, he is held up in some traffic and will take 30 minutes to reach the place. There was one more person in the clinic waiting for the doctor. With absolutely nothing else to do till doctor turns up, we started conversing with each other. These places gives a wonderful opportunity to have a side talk on current affairs :-) You will get ample of these kind of talks if you go to Jayanagar 4th block, sitting next to senior citizens' adda (just opposite to Ganesha fruit juice). It is an experience by itself :-)

So, we started discussing (not surprisingly) about traffic problems in Bangalore and how Bangaloreans blame each and everything on traffic :-) You get late to office, blame on traffic. Get late to wedding, blame it on traffic. So, now we have an alibi to justify the delays in our day-to-day life, irrespective of the traffic. How true, am sure you would have experienced the same, sometime or the other.

Our discussions also turned towards "misuse of mobile technology", as people give wrong places while they are in a totally different part of the city. Gentleman was suggesting that mobiles should display the location of the "caller" to know the truth :-) How true !!!

Still there was no sign of doctor. We had to continue with some more discussion on hot topic. What else can be better than "terrorism"? We vented our anger against the government (what else can we do?) that some of the terrorists are just kept in the jail for a long time and the trial goes on forever. It is an utter waste of citizen's money to keep feeding these terrorists in the jail. We were about to kill all those terrorists with our words, but by then the doctor came in. So, we had to stop our conversation there and move on with business.

It was a nice Saturday morning side-talk with a total stranger for about 30 minutes. I just enjoyed it, what other better way to kill time?
