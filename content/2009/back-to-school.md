(With special thanks to my father, who is there to support Poorvi at the school)

Summer is almost over, thankfully. Summer vacations are almost over for the kids, oh so sad :-(

Just go back in times, when you used to have summer holidays back in school. It used to be so fun for 2 months, lot of playing around, go hunting for mangoes and "neraLe hannu" in some parks, visit ajja-ajji's place, get pampered from everyone and just hope that June month never comes :-) All good things have to end and so does summer holidays :-(

So, history repeats itself, only the characters have changed. Poorvi had her "first" taste of summer vacation this year and now its all over, back to school for her. She has to go to a new class, get used to the new teacher and to make it even worse, she is now been put into a different section :-( She is already getting the taste of "re-org" at this early age :-) All her old-time friends are in a different section and she in a totally new section :-( Uh, lot to cope up and she is already showing signs of dissent :-(

Today, she cried a lot to go to school and it was one touching moment for me to just dump her into the bus, while she was crying inconsolably. At office, I am still thinking about her, hope she is fine and enjoying the company of new friends, new teacher and new things to learn.
