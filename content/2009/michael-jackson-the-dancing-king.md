*(A tribute to a great dancer of our times)*

As usual, I woke up today around 6:30 AM and switched on the TV. 9X-M or other music channel is a kind of wake-up alarm for Poorvi. So, it is my habit that I switch on the TV and by the time I get ready, Poorvi would have woken up watching the TV. Today was no different, but it was a breaking news to begin the day :-( I was shocked to see the news report on sudden demise of MJ :-(

Just when he was trying to make a mother of all comebacks, with 50 odd stage performances planned in UK next month, this happened :-(

Inarguably he was the best dancer of our times. Moonwalk dance was a craze in those days. There are so many people who imitated him (Prabhudeva for example), but only few people managed to meet his standards in dancing. His videos were a treat to watch, with many futuristic and fairy themes :-)

It is sad that he is no more :-( We are now left with only his memories of great songs and some stupendous dance steps. Although there were many allegations against him at different times of his life, it did not stop any of us admiring him as God of Pop music. Truly a once-a-generation sensation.

RIP MJ.
