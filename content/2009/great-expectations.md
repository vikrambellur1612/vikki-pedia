This incident happened while I was having a chat with my cook some days ago. He asked me "aap Nokia phone use karte hai na"?. I nodded my head. Then he asked me for a favor. "Idhar se Orissa ke liye sasthe main phone karne ka plan batha dena". Uh, I don't know if he has an Airtel SIM or Vodafone or in fact Tata Docomo :-) So, I told him he has to talk to the operator like Airtel or Vodafone. He was not convinced. Probably he did not know the SIM and what has gone into his phone. He again asked me back - "Aap office main kya karte ho? Aap ke office main pooch ke bata dena Nokia phone se sasthe main phone kaise karna hain". Umm, I could no longer argue with him, I told I will try to find out.

Just to end the conversation, he had one more question " Nokia mobile se hi sasthe main call kar sakte hai na, doosre mobile se mehanga padta hain"? This question is like asking a barber if one needs an haircut. What else can I tell him? For once, I felt he should have been in US of A to get that user experience of integrated mobile and tariff package :-)

Same cook goes to one of my friend's apartment. His wife happens to be a dentist. Again last week, our cook had fever. So, he goes to the dentist and asked for some medicine to cure his illness. Rightly, she refused to give him any medicine. Our cook was shocked and could not believe that people are so against him. One person is not giving right "tariffs", other one not giving "medicines" to cure his illness. He was complaining to us "Kis taraf ki doctor hain wo, dawayee nahi deti, hamare Orissa main tho aisa nahin hain, sab bheemari ke liye, sabi doctor dawaayi dete hain", his list of complaints continued forever.

I am sure he would have had similar expectation on me, for sure he would have cribbed in similar lines elsewhere :-)

I think this kind of expectations from people are not new to us, right? There were times when Veena was asked which Petrol bunk she works for (HP), whether we made Shikakhai soaps (for Wipro) etc. If you can explain your position and clarify these doubts, well and good. Otherwise, learn to live with these great expectations :-(
