# Dramayana - Jai ho

Festival season has just begun in India. I feel, Aug-Sep-Oct quarter is a tough quarter for people trying to reduce weight :-) First of all, it is either raining or pretty cold to venture out much. Then the range of sweets & other dishes you get to eat during Ganesha-Navaratri-Deepavali season does little good to your body too. Anyway, this quarter is also a season of joy, celebrations, coming together with your family and friends.

To celebrate Ganesha festival, there was a fun filled evening organized in our apartment as well. The program was themed around Ramayana. All important events of Ramayana were depicted through some modern dance sequences.

Hilarious part of this dance sequence was - "Aaja meri gaadi main bait jaa" song sequence, where the so called "Rakshasas" come in modern scooter (kid's scooter), and trying to woo Sita to come with them for a ride :-) As usual Sita falls for this tactic & hitches a ride all the way to Lanka.

Then, as usual Rama/Lakshmana have to go to Lanka to get Sita back right? So they do. There was a song sequence "Jai ho" from all the "monkeys" to boost the morale of team Rama to go to Lanka & win the war. Poorvi was one of the monkey in this dance sequence.

This dance was done by kids of age around 3 to 5 years. They all had enthusiastically prepared for this big day from last couple of months, practicing Jai-ho dance day-in & day-out. The whole dance sequence came out really good & I was pleasantly surprised that these monkeys did carry themselves quite nice, with all those costumes.

Poorvi and gang are now practicing bollywood dance for next set of songs already. As Navaratri & Deepavali celebrations are also coming up, these kids will get more chance to show off their talents. Jai Ho.
