# Art & Science of PMP

Back after a long break. :-) First, it was my PMP exam that was taking much of my time in preparations. Then a trip to Orissa. Hope I will get more time to write more in 2010.

One of my long outstanding desire to be a PMI certified Project Management Professional came true in the first week of December. Initially when I looked at the 500 odd page reference book, I was little bit apprehensive about clearing the exam successfully. People who had already cleared the exam also gave a hint to take this exam seriously, online reviews also said so. Some of the online feedback was so scary that I had kind of prepared for the worst :-)

But, around two months of preparation, some mock tests made this whole stuff look so easy. On the day of exam I was quite confident of clearing the exam, I only wanted to check my Proficiency levels in different categories (Knowledge areas).

To my disappointment I did not get "Proficient" (90% +) in many categories :-( Anyways, PMP is a PMP, scores does not matter later :-)

For any of you aspiring to take PMP exam here are some tips:

• Read Rita Mulchay's "PMP Exam Prep" and solve all the questionnaire. Try to cover one chapter each day & take the questions related to the chapter.
• Once you complete Rita Mulchay, refer to PMBOK. It is easier to read PMBOK after reading Rita Mulchay.
• Take some practice tests from [www.pmstudy.com](http://www.pmstudy.com/), [http://www.headfirstlabs.com/PMP/free_exam/](http://www.headfirstlabs.com/PMP/free_exam/)

All the best !!!
