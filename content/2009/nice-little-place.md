# Nice little place

After we visited a place called - "Kids Kouch" (a nice place, will probably write a blog later on this), we wanted to get a good coffee & some light snacks. As the roads were completely empty, we just went around in the car to look out for a good place to have evening snacks. As we drove down on 12th main in HAL 2nd stage, we happen to pass by a lovely home which had the board "Daddy's Deli Cafe & restaurant". We went in to check the place.

Ambience was just good for the evening, to sit in their front garden & sip coffee. We ordered Mawa cake, Bombay Bhel, Coffee & Masala Chai. All the items were very well made. We were quite impressed with the Mocha cake & ice cream accompanying the same. I tried their filter coffee, which was really good. Overall, we did not expect a great deal, but were thrilled to get such good stuff.

This is the charm of Indiranagar & some other places in Bangalore like Koramangala & Ulsoor. There are so many small yet good places hidden in the residential area. A big bungalow in these locality are transformed into nice hang-out place.

Daddy's Deli also have a Parsi restaurant in the first floor. We will probably go back to them sometime to try their authentic Parsi food. Anyone game for it? :-)

If you happen to be in Indiranagar & want to try out a good place for snacks/meal, visit "Daddy's Deli", you will not regret. Average price for snacks/coffee per person would be around 100 Rs. They have all-day breakfast menu, which costs around 200 Rs/head.

**Address:**
Daddy's Deli, Executive Inn, 3289, 12th Main, HAL 2nd Stage, Indiranagar, Bangalore-38

If you are coming from Airport road on 100 Ft road, take a first left turn after BBQ nation, go straight for about 1.5 to 2 Kms, you will get 12th main road, take a right turn, go for about 500 mts. This place is on the right side of the road.
