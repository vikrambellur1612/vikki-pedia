This project is a Vite + React + TypeScript blog site with CSS Modules, designed for ultra-modern, responsive UI and PWA/Netlify deployment. Blog content is stored locally (not just linked) and should be accessible by date, tag, and type. Prioritize clean, mobile-first layouts and modern navigation.
